# J- Interpreter (Written in C)

**J-** is a minimal, JavaScript-inspired interpreted language designed for simplicity and learning.  
This project implements a full interpreter for J- in C, including lexing, parsing, compiling to bytecode, and executing with a stack-based virtual machine.

## 🔧 Features

- 📄 Tokenizer (Lexer) — Converts source code to tokens  
- 🌲 Parser — Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens  
- 🧠 Bytecode Compiler — Translates AST into bytecode instructions  
- 💻 Stack-based Virtual Machine — Executes bytecode using a custom VM  
- 🧠 Variables and Arithmetic  
- 🔁 While Loops and Conditional Statements  
- 🗣️ Print Statements  
- ⚙️ Function Definitions and Calls  
- 🚧 (Planned) Garbage Collection and more advanced language features

## 📄 Example J- Code

```jminus
let x = 0;

while (x < 5) {
  print(x);
  x = x + 1;
}

fn square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

yap(square(4));
